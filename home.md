Bio
---

I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia, where I went to Middle Harbour
Public School, Neutral Bay Public School and North Sydney Boys High School. In
1969 we spent a year in Tübingen and London, and in 1975-76 a year in New
Haven.

My parents were both mathematicians and I followed in their footsteps, studying
pure mathematics and computer science at the Australian National University in
Canberra. My doctorate was in applied mathematics, looking at the geometry of
self-assembled microstructure in surfactant systems, somewhere in the grey area
between physical chemistry and soft-matter physics. I was based at the ANU but
also spent time in Paris and Lund. I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux
and ANU, and taught mathematics at the University of Sydney and at Macquarie
University, Sydney. In the late 90's I changed fields to computing and taught
at the ANU for almost ten years.

In 2003-4 I studied writing at the University of Canberra. In 2006-7 I trained
as a psychotherapist and counsellor at the Jansen-Newman Institute in Sydney. I
practiced counselling part-time in Canberra until the end of 2009.

Together with my ex-wife I moved to Scotland in 2010 and lived there for 7
years. During that time I taught computing at the University of the Highlands
and Islands.

Since August 2018 I have lived in France, near Paris.

Work
----

I work as a software developer at [Cryptosense][cryptosense] in Paris.

From January 2017 to August 2018 I worked as a software developer at
[Quintessence Labs][qlabs] in Canberra, writing key management software that
works with the company's unique quantum random number generator technology. I
was particularly involved with our handling of public key infrastructure.
Recently I have also been involved in troubleshooting customer support issues.

From August 2010 until January 2017 I was a lecturer in [computing][] at [Moray
College][MC], part of the [University of the Highlands and Islands][UHI]. I
taught mostly programming and software-related courses, at all levels from
Further Education (Level 6 in the Scottish system) to honours (Level 10). I was
the Programme Leader for the [UHI BSc (Hons) Computing degree][degree]. I was
involved in research in computing education.

Before 2010 I was (in reverse order) a reseach analyst at the [Australian
National Data Service][ANDS], a lecturer in [computer science][DCS] at the
[Australian National University][ANU], a lecturer in mathematics at [Macquarie
University][MU], a postdoctoral researcher in [applied mathematics][applied
maths] at [ANU][], a lecturer in applied mathematics at the [University of
Sydney][USyd], a postdoc at the [CNRS][] [Centre de Recherche Paul
Pascal][CRPP] in Bordeaux, a PhD student in applied mathematics at ANU and an
undergraduate student in mathematics and computer science at ANU.

Interests
---------

- bushwalking / walking / hiking / randonnée, whether in mountains, forests or
  along coastlines. I have done a few walks of a week or so: the Great Glen Way
  in Scotland, to Djebel Siroua in the Ante-Atlas mountains in Morocco, and
  around the Kaisergebirge in Austria.

- music: choral singing, in particular of the baroque period, English and
  French madrigals etc., also playing the piano: Bach, Beethoven, Schubert,
  Mozart...

- Australian literature, particularly Helen Garner, Tim Winton, Richard
  Flanagan...

- non-formulaic science fiction: Ursula K. LeGuin, Doris Lessing, William
  Gibson, Margaret Atwood, Cory Doctorow, Neal Stephenson

- politics, social change, science, the environment

- personal growth, trauma, sexual politics, men's work
