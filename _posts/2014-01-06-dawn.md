I give thanks for the beauty of the clouds this morning just before sunrise.

This morning I went back to work for the first time after the Christmas and New Year break. I wasn't looking forward to it. Lots to do. Politics. Bureaucracy. I went in with as positive a state of mind as I could manage, but I was still aware of being anxious and unsettled. And then, just after 8:30am, I looked out the window and saw this:

What a gift! Of course I couldn't maintain that sense of wonder for the whole day, but no matter---this was enough to make it a good day all the same.

(Note: The college is at 57° 39'N, 3° 19'W. Sunrise this morning was at about 8:55am.)
