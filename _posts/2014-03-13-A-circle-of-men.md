Open evening at the men's group.

We had fifteen men there. Seven regular members, and eight interested visitors.
That's the biggest circle I've been in since I started going. The last time I
was in a circle that big was at the community building weekend at Unstone Grange
last July. A long time ago.

There was a good energy in the room. I'm grateful.
