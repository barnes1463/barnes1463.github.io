This is Wordcube, an Android app I have on my phone, with a new puzzle each day.
You have to find words at least 4 letters long, and always containing the middle
letter. There's always a nine-letter word (sometimes two!). You get the rating
of "Godlike" if you get all the words.

Today, as you can see, I scored Godlike. I'm grateful for small pleasures like
this puzzle, and for my brain that lets me enjoy them.
