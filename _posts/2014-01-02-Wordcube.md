This is [Wordcube][], an Android puzzle game I have on my phone.

There's a new puzzle each day. You have to find as many words as you can that
are at least 4 letters long. Each word must contain the middle letter. You can't
use a letter twice (unless there are two in the grid). There's always at least
one nine-letter word.

When you start, your rating is "Below average". If you get 40% of the words in
the list, that changes to average. At 60% it changes to "Good", at 80% to
"Excellent", and on the rare occasions when you get all the words in the list,
it's "Godlike". For me that doesn't happen often. There's usually some obscure
word in there that I haven't heard of, and often a few really obvious easy words
that I just don't manage to see.

Today, as you can see, I scored Godlike. I'm grateful for small pleasures like
this puzzle, and for my brain that lets me enjoy them.

I have so many problems with my brain, specifically with "vertical integration",
but also with remembering things, that it's good to sometimes get a feeling of
competence to balance that out. I get the same thing from programming, at least
when it's going well.
