I am grateful for the train that carried me safely across the mountains and back again today.

It's the middle of winter and there's lots of snow up there. The weather was wild, with a mixture of wind and rain and snow and sleet. Driving the A9 to Perth and back would have been exhausting and dangerous. But the train was safe and warm and I even got some rest.
