I am grateful for the gift of sickness.

I spent this day in bed with a nasty cold. Sleeping, reading, thinking, resting.
Of course it's not fun, it's horrible being sick, but it's a gift all the same.

Why? Firstly there's a lesson about accepting limitations. Sometimes we can't do
what we want to, what we aspire to. We have to give in and let things take their
course, follow their own pace. I was going to finish a pile of marking and I
wasn't able to. Let it go.

Secondly, related, there's a lesson about how the world doesn't need me every
day. It carried on turning without my assistance. I'm not indispensable.
