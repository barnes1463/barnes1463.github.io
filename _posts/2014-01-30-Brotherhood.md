I give thanks for brotherhood.

We met again tonight, my brothers and I. There were nine of us. It was real. It was honest. It was messy. There was conflict, resolved beautifully and creatively, with good will and empathy. We worked. We shared. We learned. We grew closer.

We built a _container_ together, which is another word for a community.
