The squirrel was back again this morning. I only had my phone, and shooting
through the window it caught the reflection of the venetian blinds, so these
aren't great. But there he is. He's back again, a week later.

Most of the photos here are sampled down to 40% in each direction, which hides
some of the graininess and blur. These ones are cropped, because the squirrel
was so small. So you see the true quality---or lack of it---of the images.

But I don't care about any of that. Spring has arrived and this timid little
munchkin, full of life, has emerged from wherever he's been hiding all winter,
and is exploring and feeding himself up, stuffing himself full of nuts.
Beautiful.

I am grateful for small furry creatures.
