Today I'm grateful for Avigail and her influence on my life over the last seventeen years.

In particular, to be specific, she has introduced me to a world that I was mostly unaware of. I knew that there could be more to life. I knew that the world of mathematics and mathematicians was limited, and that I wanted more, but I didn't know how to get there. And Avigail led the way for me. For all these years, she's been my guide. Sometimes gentle and kind, sitting with me as I suffered, and sometimes giving me a well-earned kick in the arse, when I wasn't doing the work, particularly when that affected her, which of course it did. And always setting an example, inspiring me with her courage and determination and compassion.

I'm a *mess*. But I'm a lot less of a mess than I was, and that's largely thanks to Avigail. And even today she was there, helping me along, engaging with me. I'm grateful.

(And of course there's so much more that I haven't mentioned---her baking for example---but that's not what I want to concentrate on today. Another time perhaps.)
