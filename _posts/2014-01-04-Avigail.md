Today I'm grateful for Avigail. With all the problems we've been having, with
the likelihood that we're going to have to end up separating, I'm still so
grateful for her influence on my life.

In particular, to be specific, she has introduced me to a world that I was
mostly unaware of. I knew that there could be more to life. I knew that the
world of mathematics and mathematicians was limited, and that I wanted more, but
I didn't know how to get there. And Avigail led the way for me. For the last
sixteen years, she's been my guide. Sometimes gentle and compassionate and
sitting with me as I suffered, and sometimes understandably giving me a kick in
the arse, when I wasn't doing the work, particularly when that affected her,
which of course it did.

I'm a *mess*. But I'm a lot less of a mess than I was, and that's largely thanks
to Avigail. And even today she was there, helping me along, engaging with me.
I'm grateful.
