Today I'm grateful for Avigail.

With all the problems we've been having, I'm still *incredibly* grateful for her
influence on my life over the last seventeen years.

In particular, to be specific, she has introduced me to a world that I was
mostly unaware of. I knew that there could be more to life. I knew that the
world of mathematics and mathematicians was limited, and that I wanted more, but
I didn't know how to get there. And Avigail led the way for me. For the last
sixteen years, she's been my guide. Sometimes gentle and compassionate and
sitting with me as I suffered, and sometimes understandably giving me a kick in
the arse, when I wasn't doing the work, particularly when that affected her,
which of course it did.

I'm a *mess*. But I'm a lot less of a mess than I was, and that's largely thanks
to Avigail. And even today she was there, helping me along, engaging with me.
I'm grateful.

(And of course there's so much more that I haven't mentioned---her baking for
example---but that's not what I want to concentrate on today. Another time
perhaps.)
