I am grateful for students who show an interest, pay attention, listen, read, think and learn.

I've spent most of the day marking student work. It's not much fun. Most students, most of the time, ignore what I say and write. They act like someone is forcing them to be in class, as if a free education is some sort of imposition on them, not an incredible gift. And the work they submit for assessment is an insult. Marking it can easily get demoralising.

So when I get a piece of work where the student has really taken in what's on offer, has grasped the ideas and applied them correctly, carefully. Has shown respect for him or herself, for the subject and the process, and for meâ€¦ it's a pleasure. It lifts my spirits to think that I've managed to get through to even one student in a class.
