I'm grateful for the beautiful sight of the new moon in the evening sky.

The passage of time, the change of the seasons, wind, rain, cloud, sun, stars,
new beginnings, cycles repeating and renewing themselves, something bright and
shiny and new growing out of the darkness, a silver ship sailing on the stormy seas...

You can't see it properly because I waited a bit too long before stopping the
car to take this, and as I discussed recently the camera phone doesn't do poor
light very well, but there's something about the glowing deep blue colour you
sometimes get in the evening sky that I've always liked. I find it incredibly
moving, can't take my eyes off it.

I remember seeing that same colour in the evening sky looking out of my bedroom
window in my parents' house in Sydney, thirty-five years ago. I was no happier
then than I am now.

I wonder what that says about me? Unable to change? Lacking commitment or
courage? Lacking brain plasticity in crucial areas?
