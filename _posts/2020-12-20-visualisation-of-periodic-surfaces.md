Here's an image I generated while I was writing my [PhD thesis][thesis]. This is
one repeating unit of the surface $$ \cos X + \cos Y + \cos Z = 0 $$, which is
similar in many ways to the Schwarz P-surface, a periodic minimal surface.

![The surface cosX + cosY + cosZ = 0](/images/Schwarz-P-Surface.png)

Here's another. This one approximates the Neovius minimal surface, and is
the solution of the equation
$$
3 ( \cos X + \cos Y + \cos Z ) + 4 \cos X \cos Y \cos Z = 0
$$

These images were all generated by a Pascal program that divided the repeating
unit cube into 20x20x20 smaller cubes. For each small cube, it computed the
function values at the 8 vertices, and if there were any sign changes,
approximated the positions of the zeros of the function along each edge by
linear interpolation, then joined these points to form a polygon that
approximates the part of the surface inside that little cube. This was done in
order from back to front so that closer polygons overwrote and obscured those
further away from the viewing point, thus avoiding the need for complex hidden
surface removal algorithms.

Each image took about an hour to produce on [Macintosh IIci][], a pretty powerful
desktop workstation back in 1989.
