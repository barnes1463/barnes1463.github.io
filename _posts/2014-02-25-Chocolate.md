I am grateful for chocolate.

In the office we always have emergency chocolate on hand, hiding away in
different people's top desk drawers, just in case someone needs it. After a hard
class, after the latest management idiocy, after a long and pointless meeting...
There's always chocolate.

Personally I prefer dark, but not too dark. The new 85% doesn't do it for me.
Probably my favourite would be with almonds or hazelnuts, but I'm not that
fussy. At least, not in emergencies.

While I'm on the subject of chocolate, it's worth just saying that a lot of
chocolate, including most of the big well-known brands, is produced in an
unethical way that is unfair to the growers, who are mostly powerless people in
poor countries, and is incredibly destructive to the earth. Try to buy Fair
Trade and organic if possible.

I give thanks for the existence of chocolate, and to the efforts of my
colleagues to make sure that the emergency chocolate never runs out.
