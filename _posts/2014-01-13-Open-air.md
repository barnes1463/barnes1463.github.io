I am grateful for the gift of the open air, for being able to put on a coat and walk out my front door into nature, for the earth below and the sky above and the trees and fields around me, for the woods, the river, the cows and sheep and horses, the clouds, the sunshine, the frost and the mud.

Here is the big field, basking in midwinter sunshine.

The grassy bridge over the river Nairn.

An old dry-stone wall, starting to make its transition back into the landscape, overgrown with moss and ferns.

The beautiful Nairn valley, looking west towards the Culloden battlefield, and beyond that, hidden, over the hill, the "city" of Inverness.

I give thanks for the opportunity to take an hour out of my day to walk in this landscape, fill my lungs with cold, clean air, and connect with the world in the present, all griefs and anxieties forgotten for a while.
