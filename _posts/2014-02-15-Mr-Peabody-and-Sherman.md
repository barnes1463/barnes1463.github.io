I am grateful for sweet, inspiring children's films, like the one I saw today:
_Mr Peabody and Sherman_.

It's totally benign. Even the bad guys aren't too bad, and nothing bad happens
to them in the end when they get defeated. The messages are wholesome, the
characters endearing and funny, the excitement contagious. I was the only
unaccompanied adult in the cinema, but I don't mind that any more. I loved it.

If you have a child, take him or her. If you don't have one, go anyway. After
all, even if you don't have a physical child to take care of, you have an inner
child who needs constant care and nurturing. What could be better for that
relationship than taking your inner child to a children's film once in a while?
Deal firmly but kindly with the objections of your inner teenager, who will very
likely be embarrassed about going to a kid's film. Don't dismiss those concerns,
instead reassure and explain, and promise to go to an adolescent film---a
thriller, or a romantic comedy perhaps---some time soon. I don't care how grown
up and serious you are, you owe it to yourself to take care of those inner
parts.
