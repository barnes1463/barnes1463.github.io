There was a small flock of geese grazing in a field as I drove past this
morning.

I just had to stop and watch them for a while. They were big birds with orange
beaks and feet. Greylag geese, _Anser anser_, I think. About twenty of them.

They were eating grass, taking turns to keep watch, just as T. H. White
describes in _The Once and Future King_. (Read it. Beautiful book.)

They were too far off to take a picture, so after watching them for a few
minutes, and probably making them a bit nervous, I wound up the window and drove
on. To my job. Where I know I'm doing good, but why does it have to be done in
such a crappy way? Why do I have to end up feeling overworked and
underappreciated---not to mention underpaid. Why do I feel like I'm missing out
on something when I see wild geese grazing in a field, or when I see flocks of
hundreds of them flying, organising themselves into ragged V shapes, heading
south, north, wherever.

_A few days later (Monday 10th March)_: This morning I saw a few of them, maybe
four or five, flying in formation, across the road. Low and fast. It looked like
they'd just taken off from the field where I saw them last week and were trying
to gain height. I wonder where they were off to? Just a short flight looking for
a new field to graze, or maybe some water? Or setting off on a migration?
Iceland? Norway? Siberia? Go well, brothers and sisters. Have a safe flight.
