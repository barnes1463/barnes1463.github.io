I give thanks for the woods and fields around our house, and the ever-changing
light on this beautiful landscape.

This afternoon I went for a walk around "the loop": down the hill to our bridge,
across the river, along the road past a few houses, then up past the cows to the
crossroads. Then left and along the road past the farm, where I said hello to
one of the carthorses.

He was standing above me, so the sky was the only background. This picture's all
washed out as a result, but I like the effect.

The late afternoon sun came out for a little while, casting a magical golden
light on everything. If you look hard, on the left you can see Kilravock Castle,
built in the 14th century and still lived in.

Then carefully down along the edge of what used to be a
pine forest until the land owner cut them all down, and back across the river on
the grassy bridge, stopping for a minute to look both ways.

The sun setting behind the trees at a quarter past three, looking upstream along
the River Nairn...

... and catching the tops of some of the trees looking downstream.

Then through the
woods and along the edge of the big field, admiring the cloudscape.

And finally back past the laird's mansion and back home. It was almost dark when
I got back, and there was a crescent moon showing, just above the trees
silhouetted against the sky.

An inspiring way to end my two week break from work.
