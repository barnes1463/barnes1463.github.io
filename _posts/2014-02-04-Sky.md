I am grateful for the endlessly fascinating skies I see as I drive to and from work. I know I've rattled on about this before, but I just love the skies here.

Skies in Australia were different. Often boring. People from here don't understand. "How could you not like a cloudless blue sky?" But it's boring, and it gets oppressive. Not like here. Every day the clouds are different. When the sun is low in the sky, you often get incredible colours.

This shot really doesn't capture what I saw: the layers and textures of the clouds. For a start, flattening them out to two dimensions loses something. Also it took me a while to find somewhere I could pull over safely, and the light was fading from one moment to the next. It was really pretty dark by the time I took this, and the little camera in my phone has cranked up the ISO all the way and used a long exposure in order to get anything at all. So this is all grainy and there's motion blur on the lights of the timber lorry going past.

But it is what it is. An attempt to capture something I saw and liked. A memory. A reminder. That life isn't all emails and marking and bureaucracy and meetings and lazy students. All that shit is just a temporary, flawed human construction that has very little to do with anything important. We ants scurry about, and above us the weather unfolds, oblivious.

I'd like to think that every driver on that road was looking and marvelling at the colours and the clouds: the last slender ribbon of pink-orange-yellow, the clouds gone black as the earth's rotation takes them into shadow, the deep blue glow of the sky, still scattering blue photons from higher and higher as the sun departs. I hope so.

For the curious, this photo was taken on the A96, just east of Forres, looking west-ish, at twenty to six, almost an hour after sunset.
