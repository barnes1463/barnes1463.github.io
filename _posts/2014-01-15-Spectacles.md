I am grateful for the marvel of spectacles.

At fifty years old, I can't read unassisted, print or computer screen or car number plates. I can't see the television across the room properly: can't read subtitles or see facial expressions. My eyesight is rubbish.

I've had reading glasses since I was twenty-one, the year I wrote my honours thesis. I got stronger ones when I was finishing my PhD. It stayed that way for another almost twenty years and then the rot set in. Now I can't see properly at any distance.

And so tonight I picked up my new varifocals.

The top half lets me see at a distance, anything from about three metres and out (prescription +1.5), below that it slides smoothly into just what I need for screens and middle distance (prescription +3.0) and then down at the bottom there's a little spot with my reading prescription (+3.25). I'm amazed at all the detail out there in the world that I couldn't see. I drove the car with them on, and I could read the instruments again.

They're not great for a big computer screen like this one, because the middle-distance zone isn't the full width of the lens. (It can't be: think about the optics. What shape would the lens be?) So I'll keep some of my old reading glasses near computer screens. But for everything else they seem great.

And for the opportunity to extend my useful vision past the age of forty-five, I'm grateful.
