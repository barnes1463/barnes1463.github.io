I love the sound of the birds.

There are so many of them, and they chatter away all the time. Unlike the sound
of the river, I can hear them even inside the house. It's a lovely noise to
wake up to, now that the sun is rising earlier so I'm not always getting up in
the dark.

Maybe I'm weird, but I'm particularly fond of the sparrows. I have nothing
against the rest: blackbirds, tits, chaffinches... but for some reason I have a
soft spot for sparrows. They seem so cheerful.
