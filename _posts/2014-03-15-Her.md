I saw the film _Her_ this evening, with Joaquin Phoenix.

I was moved as well as intrigued. An interesting vision of a near future. Some
nice ideas about technology, artificial intelligence, the so-called
singularity---something that I don't believe in, by the way. (For the record, I
don't think artificial intelligences with real emotions and consciousness are
possible in the foreseeable future, but what do I know? There seems to be
precious little human intelligence around.)

The main character is a sad, lonely man. Reminded me a bit of myself, except
that I think he's better than me. There was a conversation with his ex-wife,
while they're signing their divorce papers, that was painful to watch. She
accused him of forming a relationship with the AI because he can't handle the
real emotions of a real person.

In the end... but no, no spoilers. Go and see it for yourself.
