This is the first in what I hope will be a daily series of blog posts and images of things I'm grateful for. I'm following a suggestion I saw on Facebook called the [365 Grateful project](http://www.365grateful.com/).

The first thing I'm grateful for, on the 1st of January 2014,  is my inner child. He's the sad little boy who I carry with
me everywhere. He's the one who's afraid all the time. He's the one with the imagination and the potential for joy and creativity and energy. He's also the one who feels totally out of his depth in the world, and just wants someone to take care of him. Preferably a strong, kind, safe man. Like me, or at least, like I'd like to be, like the me that I'm struggling to become.

Here he is. This is me when I was small. I don't know, maybe two or three years old?
