I am grateful for the beach in winter.

This was Nairn beach, late in the afternoon. It was windy, with dramatic light coming from behind the clouds.

There were geese here, but my pictures of them didn't come out. Humans have hunted geese too much for them to be comfortable having their pictures taken except from a distance, and the camera in my phone doesn't have much of a long lens.

They came in flying very low across the water, into the wind, flying in a perfect V shape, smoothly and quietly, about twenty or thirty of them, and then all of a sudden they were down at the edge of the water, some of them floating, bobbing up and down with the waves, others walking on the sand and the rocks, bending their necks into funny shapes and eating something they found there. 

Ever since reading T.H. White's _The Once and Future King_ I've been a fan of geese. I loved the description of their joyful anarchist society, as experienced by the Wart---the young Arthur, before he realises he's going to be a king, living as an orphan, as a kind of lesser younger brother to Kay, destined to become Kay's squire---when Merlin changes him into a series of different animals: ant, fish, goose… in order to learn about different ways of organising society. The ants are totalitarian. The fish are basically "Might is right". And the geese are fluid self-organising anarchists who join together to form groups as they choose, select leaders for the migration each year on the basis of ability, knowledge, wisdom and experience, who help each other gladly, by choice, without losing their individuality and freedom. It's got to be one of the most beautiful things I've ever read. The Wart---who will soon become the great, noble, wise king of legend---is heartbroken when Merlin yanks him back out into the world of humans.

What if we just chucked out all the current crop of so-called leaders: Obama, Cameron, Abbott, Putin, Merkel, Netanyahu, Harper, that pathetic French "socialist" (Ha!) Hollande with his mistresses,… And all their cronies in the board rooms of the corporations. The list of narcissistic petty criminals goes on and on.

What if we appointed the "Elders" group to run things instead? Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, Gro Harlem Bruntland, Mary Robinson and the rest of them who I'm ashamed to say I've only barely heard of. These are good people, kind people, people who are old enough not to care any more about what others think of them, old enough to have outgrown greed and prejudice and hatred, old enough and experienced enough to have gained a little wisdom, humility and compassion.

Why don't we just do that? Can't people see that we're totally fucked the way things are going?

I kept walking. I thought this cloud looked so dramatic that I kept turning around to look at it as I walked along the edge of the water. So these shots were taken looking back along the beach, roughly south-west I guess.

I think it's getting closer.

And closer, blocking out the sun.

This is looking across the Moray Firth towards the Black Isle. I think that's rain.

This last one was taken pointing back the other way, north-east, with what was left of the sun behind me.

I like the solitary gull that I caught by accident, and the way the sun lights up the clouds.

Even among the stupidity and my feelings of anger and depression and despair about it all, there's this: a bird soaring free on the wind, clouds lit up by the sun, an almost empty beach washed gently by cold waters. And I'm grateful.
