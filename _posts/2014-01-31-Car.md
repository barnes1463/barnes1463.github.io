I'm grateful for my car.

It just goes and goes, my trusty twelve-year-old Volvo S60 diesel. It takes me effortlessly thirty miles to work and another thirty miles back home again, every day, in all weather, strong and steady. It only needs servicing once a year. It gets over fifty miles per gallon. Safe, solid, reliable. Perfect.

What would I do without it?
