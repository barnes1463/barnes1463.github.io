Today was a shitty day and I can't think of much to be grateful for.

I was unwell, still struggling to get over my cold. I spent most of the day
marking student work, stressed because it's all supposed to be done by tomorrow
and I'm horribly behind. I was miserable, for reasons that I can't write about
here.

It was a shitty day. I'm grateful that it's over. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
