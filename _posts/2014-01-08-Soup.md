I'm grateful for soup. That's all.

This evening when I got home from work, exhausted---knackered actually, truly worn out---there was just enough left of the soup I made the night before last that I could heat up and have a good heart bowl full. With one of A's rolls. It made all the difference.

It wasn't a good day. I'd write about that, and about my gratitude for a long conversation with A that helped me clear up what was going on for meâ€¦ but it's late and I'm tired and I need to go to sleep. So I'll save it for another time.

Goodnight.
