I am grateful for my colleagues in the department of computing and multimedia at
Moray College.

I've worked in several universities and I've never had a group of colleagues who
are so warm and supportive and with whom I share so many important values.

Maybe it's because this is primarily a further education college, a community
college, and the university-level teaching is only a part of what we do? Maybe
it's because it's not just computing, but also the digital media, graphics and
animation? Maybe it's because there's a good balance of men and women?

University mathematics and computing departments are filled mostly with men, and
most---but not all---of those men are a bit "out there", "on the spectrum",
socially awkward. Think of [Sheldon][S] on [The Big Bang Theory][TBBT]. Our
department isn't like that.

Maybe it's because this is Scotland, and not Australia or France or Sweden?
Scots are different, warmer.

In the end I don't know the reason, and it doesn't really matter. I just know
that I love the people I work with, and that makes a huge difference. Thank you,
my friends.
