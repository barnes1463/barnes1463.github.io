I give thanks for puppies. And animals in general. For their warmth and trust and energy. Their enthusiasm.

Yesterday we went to visit A's friend J, who has a new puppy. He's a springer spaniel, fifteen weeks old. Happy, gorgeous, trusting. Wet nose. Sharp little teeth. Piddling on the floor with excitement. Learning to fetch and how to behave and please his owner/pack leader, but also learning that he has a will of his own and doesn't have to obey every instruction, playing with that possibility of rebellion, joyfully. Curious about everything. Playing and sticking his nose in everything, full of energy, and then suddenly curled up in his basket, fast asleep. What a joy.

And I totally forgot to take a picture of him. What a pity.
