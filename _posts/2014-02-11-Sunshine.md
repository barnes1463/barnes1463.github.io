I am grateful for the warmth of sunshine on my face that I felt as I walked back
to the college at lunch time today.

After decades in Australia I had learned to fear that warmth as a sign that in a
few minutes I would be surnburned if I didn't do something. It's taken me four
years in Scotland to adjust. The winter sun at 57Â°N isn't going to do anyone any
harm.

So when the sun came out briefly today and warmed my face as I walked---all
bundled up against the wind and the cold with coats and gloves and scarves and
still feeling quite unwell with that cold from the weekend---it was an
unexpected pleasure.
