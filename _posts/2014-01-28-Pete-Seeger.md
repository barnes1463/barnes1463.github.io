I am grateful for the life and energy of Pete Seeger, who died yesterday, aged 94.

When I was in primary school we were taught all sorts of songs. I never knew much about them. I was much more focussed on the music than on the words, and I knew my parents looked down on all inferior music, whether it was folk or pop or jazz or rock or show tunes or whatever. If it wasn't Bach or Beethoven or Mozart then it wasn't any good and they would sneer at it and turn it off. Like many things, it was OK for ordinary people, but not for us.

So I learned these songs and loved them but also despised them, was ashamed of them, hid them away. I hadn't the faintest idea that they were political. Of course I'd occasionally find tunes running in my head. Some random sequence of notes would trigger a memory of sitting in class in Neutral Bay Primary School in 1974 singing _Where have all the flowers gone?_. To be honest, I probably got him mixed up with others a bit: with Joan Baez because we learned _Donna Donna_ in school at about the same time, with Peter, Paul & Mary because we learned _Puff, the magic dragon_â€¦ 

Later in life I heard of him, saw a documentary he appeared in, something about the sixties generation I guess. I don't remember the details. What I remember is an old guy with a smile, with full awareness of the awfulness of the world but at the same time with a boundless enthusiasm and energy. He is said to have been prepared to work for any worthy cause.

In 1955, during the McCarthy era in the US, Seeger was pulled in to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He stood up to them. Instead of invoking the fifth amendment---the right not to incriminate yourself---as many did, instead he invoked the first amendment: the right to freedom of speech, religion and association. On those grounds he refused to answer questions about who he met with, what events he played at, and so on, and whether or not he was a member of the communist part. In 1961 he was sentenced to ten years for contempt of Congress, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.

And all that was before I was even born. He kept on singing and speaking out for another more than fifty years. He was married for almost seventy years, and died less than a year after his wife.

Here's a YouTube link from 1963, the year I was born, from a concert he did in Melbourne.

Contrast his energy and freedom with the stiffness and sadness of the faces in the audience, particularly the men. They're all wearing ties and trying to keep a proper reserve on their faces, even as they sing along. And they're mostly wearing ties.

Pete Seeger, great soul, rest in peace.
