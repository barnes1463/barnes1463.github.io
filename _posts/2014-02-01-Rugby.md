France 26, England 24.

I know, it's only a little thing, and instead of sitting down to watch the six
nations I'd have done a lot better to go out for a walk while there was still a
little bit of light. But I enjoyed it. There was something about seeing those
white England outfits covered in French mud that lifted my spirits. And I'm
grateful for that.

France looked like losing, down 24--19, and then when all seemed lost, scored a
brilliant try under the posts that brought the whole Stade de France to its
feet.

I seem to have written about sport quite a lot recently. Isn't that odd? It's
not something I usually pay any attention to. I don't play any sport and I
hardly watch any. I think these are echoes of childhood: as a boy I was
obsessed.
