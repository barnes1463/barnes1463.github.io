I am grateful for this glory that confronted me as I stepped out the front door this morning.

That was a surprise. On the same theme as yesterday's post, I wasn't really expecting any light at all, but I guess if I was expecting anything it was a vague greyness, not all that colour.

A few minutes later I had to stop and take another picture out of the car window.

I love the shapes of the lower clouds against the background. If you look really hard you can see the dry stone wall by the side of the road.

I know these are a bit grainy, even after cutting down from 2592 by 1944 to 1024 by 768. The phone doesn't really manage all that well in poor light. But who cares. I like them.

The light show stayed with me, changing from one minute to the next, all the way to work.
