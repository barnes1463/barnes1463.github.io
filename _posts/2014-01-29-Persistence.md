I give thanks for my ability to stick at things.

Such as it is.

I've not been good at perseverance… persistence… whatever. The way I grew up, I had to be good at everything, straight away. Trying, failing and keeping on trying was a sign of someone inferior, at least in the world I grew up in. Unluckily for me, there were plenty of things I was good at, or good enough at anyway, without having to try very hard: schoolwork, music… Other things that I wasn't so talented at were less important.

It didn't matter somehow that I wasn't good at cricket. It's strange, because I really wanted to be, but somehow there wasn't support or role modelling for dogged persistence in my family. It just wasn't a quality that was valued. I stuck at cricket for years in a half-hearted way, being useless at it and wishing I wasn't. In my daydreams I scored double centuries against the Poms in the Sydney test match, and then went out and bowled them all out with a devastating spell of a couple of overs of unplayable leg spin. But in reality I guess I genuinely wasn't talented. I think as a boy I lacked coordination; that only came after I grew. But I'm also certain that the boys who were good at cricket worked at it, every day, practising with their fathers and brothers and uncles and if there was no-one around they would throw the ball against the wall and catch it or hit it on the rebound, again and again and again. I tried that too---a bit---but never with that single-minded determination to succeed that others had. In the end it didn't matter enough to me. I was always going to succeed at the things that _really_ mattered. That was just assumed. And I was embarrassed and a bit ashamed about wanting to be good at something that I wasn't.

(There's a story about Don Bradman, told by him---and I guess we have to believe him---that when he was a kid he practised hand-eye coordination by hitting a golf ball against a water tank with a cricket stump. Just think about that. Remember that the water tank was made of corrugated iron, so you never knew quite what angle the ball would come back at. And how small and hard a golf ball is, and how narrow a stump is. How many hours did he do that? After that, hitting a cricket ball with a bat after it's bounced off a smooth grass pitch would just look silly. The ball would look as big as a watermelon.)

And so, in later life, when things got hard, I didn't have any experience to draw on. I got confused. I got depressed. I somehow found an ability to hang in there, to not give up. But I never learned to fight. It all just seemed too exhausting. If I just keep on turning up, surely everything will be alright, surely I will succeed the way I was brought up to, but just being better than all the others. Wasn't that what I was told, or at least made to understand?

Sorry kid, it doesn't work that way. In order to succeed at anything, you have to work at it. Hard. So it had better be something close to your heart, or you're going to hate it by the time you're finished, and you're going to make that effort many times harder than it already is. Than it has to be.

I wonder about that quality of endurance, not quitting but not really trying either. What the hell is that? Part of me wants to honour it as a strength, while another part of me thinks it's a lack of imagination or courage or something like that. If it's not right, don't just sit there enduring, get off your arse and do something about it! Smash it all up! Change something! But that's never been my way.

So, returning to my theme, I'm grateful for finding that strength and persistence in myself to keep doing this every day for almost a month now. There have been a few glitches along the way, a few days when I've been too exhausted and have just scribbled a few words in a notebook as a reminder, and not written anything until a few days later. But that's alright. Truly it's not the writing that really matters but the attitude: making a point of finding something, _anything_, to be grateful for, every day.

I'm still depressed. Life is not much fun at the moment. But this feels like something worth hanging on to, worth putting energy into, worth exercising my persistence muscles on, and slowly strengthening them.
