I turned fifty-one today. I have mixed feelings about this.

I've been having a hard time finding much to feel grateful for recently.
Avid readers of this blog will have noticed that I haven't posted
anything for about a week. Not for want of thinking about it. More like
a lack of energy, lack of ability to see the point. Objectively I'm sure
there's been no fewer things to feel grateful about. It's actually
feeling that gratitude, indeed _feeling_ anything at all much, that's
been the problem. I've been living like a zombie, going through the
motions numbly, sleeping badly and not enough, eating badly, not enough
of what I need, and too much of things that aren't good for me...

Time to pull myself out of that.

Not brutally, not that Scottish, puritanical, "Snap out of it!" but
something kinder, gentle but resolute. Taking my sad younger parts along
with me. And not paying too much attention to what anyone else thinks.

If I need to make myself lists each day then that's what I'll do. And so
what if other people find that too regimented, too rigid, feel like it
stifles creativity or something. Who cares? If it works for me... I've
always thought that creativity is often stimulated by constraints, that
a total lack of rules, constraints leads to inferior work.

And if I set up a structure for myself and then don't feel like sticking
to it, that's up to me. Just like with this blog. I said I would write
every day, and mostly I have. But sometimes I've given myself permission
not to. So if I say to myself that I will do the washing every Saturday
and the vacuuming every Sunday, that I will exercise after work on
particular days, that I will wake at six o'clock and stretch and
meditate before starting my day, and so on... that's up to me, and if I
decide on a particular day not to, then that's my business too. My life.
My decisions.

OK, more musings on life and how to live it may follow, but now I want
to turn back to gratitude. However I may feel on any day---depressed,
angry, "Fuck you", frightened, anxious, indecisive, exhausted,
defeated---I know that I have a lot to be grateful for:

- reasonable health
- work that I believe in
- a warm, dry place to live
- some good friends
- enough money to get by
- access to reasonably healthy food
- clean water
- good books to read
- access to almost infinite streams of information
- a healthy climate
- living in a beautiful landscape
- being close to mountains and the coast
- having had a pretty decent education
- living somewhere that I can think and say pretty much whatever I please

And there's plenty more.

Apparently in terms of income, I'm in the top 1% of the world, but only
the top 5% in terms of wealth. (Doesn't make any sense to me because I
think I'm incredibly lucky that we own our house outright, but I think
my college lecturer's salary is quite pitiful. So I'm surprised it's not
the other way around.)

So... fine. Plenty to be grateful for. Things could be a lot worse. Time
to go to bed and wake up tomorrow and get on with things. Work,
housework, gardening etcetera, obviously. But also taking the time to
ponder, think, feel, care for myself, write, walk in the woods, and the
hills and along the coast, watch movies, read books, play music...

Here I am at fifty-one, looking grim.
