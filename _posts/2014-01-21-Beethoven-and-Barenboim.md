I am grateful for Beethoven piano sonatas, and as if that wasn't enough, for Daniel Barenboim's performances of them.

Like Bach's music, Beethoven has been an enduring source of joy and inspiration for me. I first discovered them as a teenager and was overcome by a sweet sentimental feeling. Forbidden emotions were brought to the surface---well, to tell the truth they were _all_ forbidden---and I liked it.

I've never been a good enough pianist to play most of the sonatas. But even picking my way through all those notes, haltingly at half speed or slower, stopping and starting, in a way that must be incredibly frustrating to anyone listening, I could hear it in my head the way it ought to be. And---for better or worse---I almost always preferred doing that to putting in the hard but boring work of developing my technique enough to be able to play the Beethoven sonatas properly. At fifty now, with my finger joints stiffening, and living without a piano, there's nothing I can do about that. But I can always hope.

And in the meantime, I listen to other people play them, and play them better than I could ever have hoped to. Each brings out something different, reveals something new. Each comes to the sonatas with a different temperament, a different perspective. Alfred Brendel, Glenn Gould, Claudio Arrau, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Rudolf Serkin…

…and Daniel Barenboim. I'm probably prejudiced in his favour because I love what he's doing in Palestine, forming the East-West Divan Orchestra, conducting Wagner in Jerusalem and speaking out against the occupation. But I also love the quiet, contemplative, introspective quality he brings to the music. No showing off, no fireworks. Clear and simple and meditative. I watched a recital of his from Berlin tonight on television, and as I listened and watched the expression on his face while he played, it suddenly felt to me like he was time-travelling, channelling Beethoven himself, from that period toward the end of his life when he had stopped fighting against deafness, stopped raging, and had retreated into an inner world where he could hear the music in his head, undisturbed by any noise or music or imperfect performances.

So here's a little something. This looks like it's the same recording that I saw on television this evening. This is an early sonata, the first of the famous ones, and the only famous one that I've gotten even close to being able to play right through, Sonata No. 8 Op. 13 in C minor, "Pathétique". Enjoy.

Apparently you can get the whole cycle on DVD.
