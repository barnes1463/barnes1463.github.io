![Ian in the woods with bicycle]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015-10-09-16-52-33-Bicycle.jpg)

So my last post here was a year and a half ago. A lot has happened. It's been a difficult time. I'm 
not out of the woods yet. (So to speak.)

Last September I moved out. That sucked.

A few months later I had an extremely traumatic unrequited... infatuation. That lasted a while,
longer than seemed reasonable. Funny how one part of me can be saying, "This is utter madness!
Just stop it!", and at the same time another part is clinging to those emotions like they're a
life raft in a storm. So that sucked too.

The one good thing about it was that I realised I could still feel all that stuff. Attachment.
Desire. Longing. Excitement. I had a period of a few weeks there where I hardly slept. How far
apart are anxiety and excitement? Which was it?

Anyway, I'm grateful for that realisation. Maybe it was the first step to recovery in the
aftermath of my marriage ending. Which had actually happened before I even started this blog,
although there were still deluded parts of me thinking a miracle was going to happen and it was
all going to be fine.

After a few months when all I did apart from work was eat shop-bought soup and muesli and watch TV,
the infatuation was a trigger for some movement, although not in a good direction as it turned out.
But although the crash of rejection and grief was brutal, some minimal, minuscule spark of energy
remained.

So I was swimming regularly for a while, although that's stopped again as my energy levels dropped.
My weight dropped several kilos, down to a more or less healthy level where I could even start to
see hints of a six pack! (I know I'm ridiculous.) And then as the excitement faded to renewed grief
and depression, most of the weight came back. But at least I know it's possible---that my
organism can get into a state in which I don't eat for comfort, in which I have enough energy for
regular exercise... Now to work my way back to that, but based on a solid connection to reality
rather than a fantasy of some ecstatic connection with a woman who really only existed in my
imagination.

It's been hard.

But... The last week or so I feel like maybe something is again starting to shift. The
main sign so far is that my appetite is no longer out of control. I had a night a bit over a week
ago when I sat in front of the TV feeling miserable and ate a whole packet of chocolate biscuits,
and it's as if something switched on in my mind and I could see myself doing it. And I saw the sad,
angry, petulant child part of me that feels so unloved and demands food instead as a substitute. And
all of a sudden it wasn't in control any more. I fasted on Sunday without effort, without any strong
feeling of missing out. I did it again on Thursday, a day when I had stayed up late the night before
preparing a lecture, then taught three classes during the day, and went to my men's group in the
evening. I was tired from the lack of sleep, but never got faint, no blood sugar crashes, no feeling
of weakness. And all week---despite tiredness because I'm still not sleeping enough, and when I do go
to bed early, I just wake ridiculously early too, so frustrating---all week I've felt like my head was
a bit clearer.

Maybe I need to go on one of those sugar detox things. I've always had such a sweet tooth...

I saved up enough money to buy myself a nice bicycle at last. Still short of energy, so I haven't been
out on it as much as I would like, but it's good. That and the hill walking when I'm feeling energetic
and aventurous, and the beach or forest walks when I just feel like strolling in nature. I feel so 
much better when I get outside.

Next steps:
1. Get roof racks for the car so I can take my bike places.
2. Get my work under control a bit so I can do some other activities in the evenings, like...
3. A yoga class.
4. Meditation.
5. Art, maybe the life drawing class at the Moray Art Centre.
6. Five Rhythms Dance, since it's been recommended to me by so many people.

That's probably plenty for anyone, but if there was more time, maybe martial arts... Aikido or Qi Gong
or Tai Chi?

I've spent so long living desperately, in a scarcity mindset. Not enough money, not enough time, not
enough energy. Always exhausted.

Enough.
