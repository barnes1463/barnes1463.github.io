I am grateful for the clean cotton sheets that I'm about to slide myself between and go to sleep.

They're not new, and they're not particularly good quality. (None of that ridiculous American thread count obsession here…) They're not even in particularly good nick---there's an occasional little tear here and there, a button missing from the doona[^1] cover. They could probably do with a good ironing too, but that's not going to happen any time soon. Life's too short to iron sheets.

Just simple cotton sheets, freshly washed and dried. Luxury.

[^1]: Doona is Australian for duvet. Or duvet is Scottish for doona, depending on where you are. And if you're in neither of those places, it's a down-filled quilt, bolster, bed covering… whatever.
