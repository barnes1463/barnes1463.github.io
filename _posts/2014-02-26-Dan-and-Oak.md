I am grateful for my friends Dan and Oak.

I went to Dan's "Night Skies" thing this evening. A small group of us spent an
hour or so outside in the dark, looking at the stars. Dan showed us some of the
constellations, some of the brighter stars. It was good to be outside in the
dark, with so many stars shining so brightly down on us. Particularly inspiring
to make the mental effort to change perspective, to picture not a flat earth
with a dome of stars above, but instead a vast universe with a small planet
spinning as it orbits around a star... Mind boggling. And getting that
perspective makes personal problems seem less overwhelming.

Then later to Oak's house for a long talk: openness, insights, awareness, mutual
support.

Thank you, my friends.
