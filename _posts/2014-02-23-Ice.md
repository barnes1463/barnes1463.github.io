These are from almost a week ago. I forgot about them on the day, and only
discovered them again just now.

I went for a walk on a frosty morning and took pictures of the patterns made by
the ice in the puddles by the side of the road.

There is pattern and form in nature everywhere. Mathematics and physics at work,
creating order from chaos. The shapes of ice crystals are dictated by the
molecular structure of water, and by the physics of melting and
freezing---latent heat, diffusion... This is the same dynamics that creates
snowflakes in slightly different circumstances.

I am grateful for this, for the pleasure it gives me, for the layers of beauty
and meaning and structure that are all around us, even in a muddy puddle, in a
ditch.
