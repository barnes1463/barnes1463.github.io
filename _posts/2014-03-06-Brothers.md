I am grateful for brotherhood...

... for the opportunity to circle up and be in the company of strong, humble,
open men. Men who---like me---are on a journey of discovery and growth, who are
trying to be good men, trying to live a life worth living.

That's all. And it's not a little thing.

By the way, this may be a repeat of an earlier post, or at least very similar. I
don't care. Nobody said I have to be grateful for something _new_ every day. And
I'm not doing this in order to be interesting or entertaining. Sorry about that.

(Yes, that's right, it's Thursday again.)
