The sun is coming back, and I'm grateful.

This evening when I left work at five past five, there was a little bit of light in the western sky, a deep blue glow above the horizon. Too dark to photograph, but it was there.

Even a week ago it would have been pitch black at that hour. But we're now a month past the winter solstice, and the days are already noticeably longer.

I love the winters up here in the far north. There's something about the extreme differences between summer and winter---both in temperature and in the length of the days---that I find exciting, stimulating. I feel much more aware of the earth spinning on that tilted axis, moving around the sun, pointing towards it and then away, and then towards it again.

Sometimes I fantasise about moving even further north, up near the arctic circle. Maybe I could find a job in Trondheim or Umeå… or even Tromsø, the world's northernmost university at 69°41′N.

It's also a bit unsettling for me living up here. After four years I'm still not really used to it. In summer I have trouble sleeping when it doesn't get properly dark at night. In winter my sleep gets messed up too. The nights are so long that I don't know when to go to sleep, and there's something about getting up and getting ready for work in total darkness that I still find disorienting and exhausting.

There was something magical about seeing that light on the horizon this evening and knowing that the light is coming back. Even as I'm looking forward to the spring and summer, I'm already missing the winter and counting the months until the next one.
