I give thanks for the pleasure I got today from cutting wood. 

Simple pleasures. I was outside for half an hour. I got the
smell of earth and sawdust in my nostrils. I got mud on my
boots. I got warm despite the cold damp air. I felt the wind and
a few misty drops of light rain on my face. I had the
satisfaction of taking a messy pile of fallen branches I'd
gathered, and turning them into a fairly neat stack of logs in
the box where they can dry out. I fulfilled a commitment I made
on Thursday night.
