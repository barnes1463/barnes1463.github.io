I am grateful for rain.

It's Australia Day today, or as we used to call it "Invasion Day", celebrating---if that's the right word---the day when the English colonisers planted their flag in Sydney Cove and started the process of… well, whatever that was. Genocide? Terracide? Envirocide? So as I went for my walk I was even more acutely aware than usual of the contrast between this cool, wet place and that hot, dry place where I've spent most of my life. I feel more at home here after four years than I ever did there.

It was a windy afternoon, with rain clouds getting blown across one after the other, dramatic downpours followed by sunshine. I caught a glimpse of a bit of a rainbow, looking north-north-east across the valley.

Turning around a moment later, and looking back to the south-west I could see the next shower on its way, quite dramatic and threatening.

My friend the horse didn't seem too bothered.

Who says they don't have souls? He was standing alone in a field and saw me coming, so he came across to the fence and waited for me. We spoke for a few moments, but he didn't really have all that much to say, or perhaps it's just that I don't yet know how to listen.

The rain seemed to be catching up with me.

Getting closer...

… and closer…

… the further I got around the loop.

As it closed in I found myself looking down, unconsciously trying to keep the raindrops off my glasses. And there was more beauty.

I know Australia has its glories, its own particular harsh beauty. There were places near Canberra that I loved---the east side of the Tidbinbilla range in particular---before it all burned in 2003. I know people who still feel strongly rooted there. They say they have a sense of place, of belonging. I never did. Not really.

There's something about _this_ landscape that I feel at home in. It resonates with me as Australia never did. Maybe that's some sort of genetic memory? My ancestors were from this part of the world. Maybe it's just my preference. I don't know, or care particularly. I'm just grateful to be somewhere I can step out of my front door and feel part of the landscape rather than assaulted by it.
