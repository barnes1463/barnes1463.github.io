Specifically the Gavotte with six doubles from the _Nouvelles Suites de Pi√®ces de
Clavecin_, 1726-7.

I heard this on the radio driving home. It was a horrible version played on a
modern piano by a virtuoso pianist who clearly thought he was playing Brahms.
The less said the better.

But it reminded me of a record I used to own, of Trevor Pinnock playing a big
French double harpsichord made by David Jacques Way. Apart from the Rameau, the
record also had Handel's _Harmonious Blacksmith_ variations on it, among several
other favourite harpsichord pieces by Bach, Fischer, Couperin, Scarlatti,
Balbastre...

I must have bought it---on vinyl or course---not long after it came out in 1984,
and played it to death in Campbell Street in Ainslie, when Lesley & I lived
together there.

I never managed to finish building my harpsichord, but for years I was in love
with the sound, and this record was a big part of that.

So I'm grateful for elegant and passionate French harpsichord music from the
first half of the eighteenth century. And I'm grateful for the memories of
thirty years ago that hearing it brought back.
