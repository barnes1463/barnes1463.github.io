Today's gratitude is for friends. A year ago I didn't really have any. Work
colleagues, acquiantances, yes, but no real friends.

Then in April I went to the [MKP][] initiation at Applecross, and after that I
joined the Moray I-Group, and I've been going regularly every second Thursday
evening for eight months. And it's changed my life. I'm obviously still not out
of the woods, still have lots of problems. But now I have a group of men I can
talk to, and who I trust, and that makes a big difference.

Last night we met, and talked and worked, and I am grateful for that. I probably
shouldn't name the men who were there, since everything that happens in our
group is confidential, but they showed up, as did I, and their support means a
lot to me.

I wanted to put a picture here, perhaps a picture of the fire burning in the
hearth, or the four pairs of boots sitting in a circle, but I didn't want to
break the mood of the meeting by stopping and getting my phone out... So there's
no picture today.
