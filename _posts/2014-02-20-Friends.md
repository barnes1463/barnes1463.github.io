I am grateful for the support of my colleagues and friends.

Twice today.

First in the college's first research seminar, where Gillian & I presented the
work we're doing together on student learning in programming. It was good to
have some friendly, supportive faces in the audience, to know that some of the
people there were on our side. It turned out that, with one possible exception,
everyone was interested and more or less in agreement, so the support wasn't
strictly necessary. But it was good to see Audrey, Lynne, Yvonne, Anna & Graham
there, cheering us on.

And later in group. There were eight men there. It felt good to spend the
evening with my brothers.

That is all.
