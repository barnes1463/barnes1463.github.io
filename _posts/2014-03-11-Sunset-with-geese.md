As I drove homeward, there was a wonderful sunset laid out in front of me. It
changed from moment to moment and I wished I could have taken lots of pictures,
but of course I was driving, and the A96 doesn't have many places where it's
easy to pull over... By the time I got to the pool in Nairn it had mostly faded.
I took this, but it doesn't really capture it.

A few minutes earlier, I glanced up and saw an enormous flock of geese in the
sky. Lots of V shapes, overlapping, looking almost like a pattern of fish scales
or tiles on a roof. There must have been a thousand or more. All heading north,
quite high up, flying out into the Moray Firth, the North Sea. Heading for
Norway perhaps, or maybe just up to the far north corner of Scotland near
Thurso, maybe just a first leg of a longer trip... to Iceland, or even Siberia.
What a magnificent sight.
