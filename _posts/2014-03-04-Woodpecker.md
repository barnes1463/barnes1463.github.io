I heard woodpeckers tapping on trees this morning, for the first time this year.

It's a wonderful noise, something I'd never heard before coming to Scotland. I
remember the first time I heard it and realised what it was. Wow! That's a
little bird banging its beak against a tree, again and again, _really_ fast!

Sometimes they come to our bird feeder, Great Spotted Woodpeckers, always after
the peanuts, sticking their powerful beaks in through the wire mesh of the
peanut feeder. They (or maybe other birds too, but probably them) wrecked our
first peanut feeder, just bent the wires until any bird could steal whole
peanuts out through the gaps they made.

They're extremely shy, more so than any of the other birds that come. The
slightest movement in the house and they're off. We've seen at least one male
and at least one female. I've never seen them tapping though, only heard it,
like this morning.

Spring is on the way. The woodpeckers are a sure sign. But then as I was driving
to work I saw that fresh snow had fallen overnight on the hills.

I am grateful for living somewhere that the natural world is so close, so
present, where there are creatures and processes and patterns that unfold around
me and bring me back again and again to the present moment, to this place, to
what is happening here, now.
