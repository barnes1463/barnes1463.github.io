I give thanks for our two beautiful kitties, Fritz and Laura.

These innocent---but far from simple or "nice"---creatures have brought so much joy into our lives for the last thirteen years. Anyone who says animals don't have souls can't possibly have lived closely with animals. Their personalities, their individuality, the forcefulness of their presence, the clarity of their desires, the strength of their attachment and connection with us. There's simply no doubt whatsoever.

Both these cats have demonstrated ESP. When Fritz curls up and falls asleep with A on the sofa, they share each other's dreams. When Laura wants something, she stares at us, and it just comes into our heads.

Both cats have also demonstrated something that certainly looks like empathy. When one gets scolded, the other often goes to comfort them. When Fritz is sick or unhappy, Laura will lick him and then curl up with him. When one of us is at home, sick in bed, both cats will spend the whole day on the bed too, doing their version of Reiki healing at a distance.

Fritz is getting old now. He's recently lost a lot of weight and we're worried about him. He's started to look a bit frail and perhaps fearful...

But even in old age, his gaze still has incredible intensity. And he still leaps lightly from the floor up to the kitchen bench tops, the backs of sofas or chairs, or stealthily into people's laps, landing so softly, the jump judged so perfectly. And then he makes his presence known.

Laura on the other hand, has gained weight recently. The move to Scotland, and in particular to this house, has been good for her. We hardly need to feed her. She is an extremely successful hunter, living on a steady diet of mice and voles. Sometimes she brings one home for us, or for Fritz, or just to play with, but usually she just gobbles them up. We watched her once: three mouthfuls and a mouse was all gone, as neatly as you like, no mess.

And yet there's still quite a lot of the kitten in her.

Here she's cuddled up with a koala soft toy we brought from Australia.

It's hard to think that their time with us might not last much longer. It won't be the same without them around. No more cat hair covering all our clothes and clogging up the vacuum cleaner, no more wrecked carpets and furniture, no more pulled threads on our woolly jumpers. But also no more soft, warm cuddly bodies, no more friendly greetings and no more of that feeling of companionship, of sharing part of our journey with these precious creatures who bring so much joy.
