Tonight I saw the northern lights for the first time.

I got a text from Dan at nine, and another from Avigail at a quarter past saying
that Ashley had phoned. I was just about to leave the pub where a few of us had
eaten: Ian and Magnus from Orkney, Euan from Shetland, George from Lewis, Fiona
and Eric from Thurso, and me. They're all visiting for our annual faculty
conference.

So I detoured to Findhorn beach on the way home, and stood for half an hour,
transfixed, until cold ears drove me back to the car.

The aurora covered almost half the sky: from the Big Dipper in the east, past
Polaris, Cassiopaea and right across to the Pleiades in the west, and from
almost down to the horizon right up to directly overhead. When I first got
there, the western part of it, toward the Pleiades, was reddish and the rest was
green. After a while, the colours died down, and it was just a slightly greenish
white. At this stage it looked like mist, lit up by city lights perhaps, except
that I could see straight through it to bright stars behind.

And it moved. Mostly not very fast, but occasionally great bright wisps that
reached across half the sky would disappear or come into being, or move to a new
position. It was all a lot slower than what I've seen on television. I guess
they must be deliberately speeding it up for dramatic effect, using time-lapse
photography.

Mostly it looked like mist, with lots of streaks going down toward the northern
horizon, and sometimes a thicker sort of wisp winding across the sky low down,
a bit like the bottom edge of a curtain. A very fuzzy fluffy curtain, not
anything like as clear and bright and sharp as I've seen on television.

But sharp or not, this was incredible. Charged particles given off from the sun,
probably during a solar flare, take a few days to reach us and then are directed
toward the poles by the earth's magnetic field, fly down into the atmosphere and
light up gas particles fairly high up---about fifty miles. This aurora looked
much lower than that.

I am grateful to my friends for alerting me, and to the universe for giving me
the opportunity to see this amazing sight.

I tried to take a picture, but not surprisingly, the phone couldn't really
capture this.
