I give thanks for the wild hills of the Scottish highlands.

Today four of us climbed Carn nan Tri-tighearnan, the hill of the three
lairds. It's between the valleys of the Nairn and Findhorn rivers,
between the Cawdor estate and Moy. There's a bare rolling plateau of
"peat hags" up there. We went in from Moy, on the west side. Up the
valley of a little river most of the way, and then across the moors,
stumbling on the soft uneven ground, up to the summit. It was extremely
windy on the top, not much fun that part.

But it was good to get out into the hills, into the wild, away from cars
and roads and houses and lots of people. The views from the top were
good, although not as great as we'd hoped because there was lots of
cloud about. We were glad we hadn't gone up Ben Wyvis (a thousand feet
higher) as originally planned, because it was in the clouds.

Here are some photos.

Setting off, through the fields of the Moy estate.

View from the summit, looking roughly south, toward the Cairngorms,
although you can't see them for all the cloud.

Looking roughly west, I think, back the way we came. That's a peat hag
in the foreground, apparently.
