I am grateful for living in a warm house.

I am not yet fully recovered from my cold, and so I'm aware that I've been
feeling the cold much more than usual this week. Yesterday I really felt it
coming home, and was dismayed to come into a cold house. As it happens, the
timer doesn't click on until six, and I was a little earlier than usual getting
home. And so I went into the laundry and pressed a little override button, and
within a second or two the furnace fired up and oil flowed from the tank, and
within a couple of minutes the radiators were hot and very soon the house was
comfortable and warm.

I recognise what an incredible privilege this is. So many people in the world,
even in this country, don't have access to adequate heating. For some they can't
afford the fuel. For others it's that their houses are so poorly built that any
heat generated just leaks out, leaving them cold and damp.

I'm also aware that the oil we burn is an irreplaceable resource made of trees
that died millions of years ago, and that burning it puts CO<sub>2</sub> into
the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. I
don't like that we rely on this form of heating, and I'd like to change it to
something more environmentally friendly, but it doesn't look like we'll be able
to afford that any time soon.
