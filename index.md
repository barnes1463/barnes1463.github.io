Bio
---

I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia. My parents were both mathematicians
and I followed in their footsteps, studying pure mathematics and computer
science at the Australian National University in Canberra. My doctorate was in
applied mathematics, looking at the geometry of self-assembly in surfactant
systems, somewhere in the grey area between physical chemistry and soft-matter
physics. I was based at the ANU but also worked in Paris and Lund (in the south
of Sweden). I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux and ANU, and taught
mathematics at the University of Sydney and at Macquarie University, Sydney. In
the late 90's I changed fields to computing and taught at the ANU for almost ten
years.

As well as being a mathematician, scientist and computer scientist, I am also a
qualified psychotherapist and counsellor, having trained at the Jansen Newman
Institute in Sydney in 2006 and 2007. I practiced counselling part-time in
Canberra until the end of 2009.

Together with my ex-wife I moved to Scotland in 2010 and lived there for 7
years. During that time I taught computing at the University of the Highlands
and Islands.

I am interested in personal growth and healing from trauma, in science fiction,
science, politics, film, literature, the environment, music and hill walking.

I am married to CÃ©line Claustre, a wonderful French school teacher who lives in
Gif-sur-Yvette, near Paris. In late 2018 I plan to move to France to be with
her, and will be looking for employment in the Paris area, preferably on the
south or west side.

Work
----

I work as a software developer at [Quintessence Labs][qlabs], writing key
management software that works with the company's unique quantum random number
generator technology. I am particularly involved in rewriting and extending our
handling of public key infrastructure. Recently I have also been involved in
troubleshooting customer support issues.

From August 2010 until January 2017 I was a lecturer in [computing][] at
[Moray College][MC], part of the
[University of the Highlands and Islands][UHI]. I taught mostly programming and
software-related courses, at all levels from Further Education (Level 6 in the
Scottish system) to honours (Level 10). I was the Programme Leader for the
[UHI BSc (Hons) Computing degree][degree]. I was involved in research in
computing education.

Before 2010 I was (in reverse order) a reseach analyst at the
[Australian National Data Service][ANDS], a lecturer in [computer science][DCS]
at the [Australian National University][ANU], a lecturer in mathematics at
[Macquarie University][MU], a postdoctoral researcher in
[applied mathematics][applied maths] at [ANU][], a lecturer in applied
mathematics at the [University of Sydney][USyd], a postdoc at the [CNRS][]
[Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal][CRPP] in Bordeaux, a PhD student in applied
mathematics at ANU and an undergraduate student in mathematics and computer
science at ANU.
