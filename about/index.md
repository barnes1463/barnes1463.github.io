My name is Ian Barnes.

Why this blog?
--------------

Because "better out than in".

Or to express that a little more fully: In life there's a natural flow in and
out of every organism. We take in, and we give out. Food, obviously, and water.
But what I mean here is energy, love, ideas. We give and we receive, ideally in
some sort of balance. Just like a country or business can run an economic
surplus or deficit, so each individual runs an energetic surplus or deficit. For
most of my life I've been in deficit. I've taken in a lot. I'm a constant
reader, watcher, viewer, listener. But I haven't given out much. That outward
flow has been blocked. I'm passive. Not necessarily quiet, but restrained, held
back, not a creator, a leader, an initiator... A follower, but dissatisfied in
that role.

There are various reasons I'm like this. If you read a few of the posts here you
might get a bit of an idea of why. At the moment I don't think it would be fair
to write about all that here, in public. That may change, who knows?

But the result of all that has been that I've been hiding for most of my life,
keeping most of my thoughts and feelings to myself. With the result that there's
always been an invisible barrier between me and the rest of the world. I feel
it, and sometimes other people notice it too, particularly if they try to get
close to me. It started with fears, and they're mostly still there, but it's
also become a habit.

This is an attempt to rectify that. As uncomfortable as it feels, I'm putting
this out into the world for others to read. If you don't like it, you don't have
to read it. If you do, I'm glad. But it's not really about you---sorry about
that---it's about me stepping out of the shadows and into the light, to be seen.


And why gratitude?
------------------

The idea is to find one thing each day for which I'm grateful, and write
something about it. If I can take a picture or two as well, that's even better.
I'm thinking of this as a sort of a spiritual practice, an attempt at changing
the way I approach the world. I got the idea when I ran across the [365 Grateful
Project](http://www.365grateful.com/) on New Year's Day, and thought that was
some sort of omen.

I've been depressed for decades. Never enough to completely fall apart, although
that's always been one of my fears. I think I inherited insecurity about
employment from my maternal grandfather. (Not genetic obviously, but passed down
as family culture through the generations.) Never take risks. Always have a
secure job.

Depressed. Underachieving. Mediocre. Nice, competent, innocuous. Mostly
harmless. But unhappy and unfulfilled. An empty shell. Not enjoying my life or
feeling like I'm being well used. Feeling drained by my life, every day. Never
feeling like I have energy to spare, enthusiasm for more. Always weary, run
down, needing a rest.

So I'm embracing this as a sort of spiritual practice, a daily exercise in
awareness. If I'm not to get stuck and miss a day, I need to keep thinking
throughout the day, "What am I grateful for today?" I want to nurture that sort
of awareness, a part of me that observes, that sees the bigger picture, that has
perspective.

This isn't just me being a bit of a hippy (by which I mean: it is indeed me being
a bit of a hippy, but it's
also more than that), it's science. This practice is consciously aimed at
developing the neural links between my prefrontal cortex and my limbic system:
what's called vertical integration of the brain. I'm trying to reach out to and
care for and nurture the frightened, angry, traumatised younger parts of myself.


Bio
---

I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia. My parents were both mathematicians
and I followed in their footsteps, studying pure mathematics and computer
science at the Australian National University in Canberra. My doctorate was in
applied mathematics, looking at the geometry of self-assembly in surfactant
systems, somewhere in the grey area between physical chemistry and soft-matter
physics. I was based at the ANU but also worked in Paris and Lund (in the south
of Sweden). I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux and ANU, and taught
mathematics at the University of Sydney and at Macquarie University, Sydney. In
the late 90's I changed fields to computing and taught at the ANU for almost ten
years.

As well as being a mathematician, scientist and computer scientist, I am also a
qualified psychotherapist and counsellor, having trained at the Jansen Newman
Institute in Sydney in 2006 and 2007.

I have a somewhat turbulent personal history that I don't want to go into, out
of respect for others and their privacy.

Until two years ago I was married to [Avigail Abarbanel] [Avigail]. We moved
together from Canberra to the Highlands of Scotland in early 2010. Here's a plug
for Avigail's psychotherapy practice, [Fully Human Psychotherapy] [FH].

I am interested in personal growth and healing from trauma, in science fiction,
science, politics, the environment, music and hill walking.

I am a member of the [Mankind Project] [MKP], and attend the Forres I-Group.

I am a lecturer in [computing][] at [Moray College][MC], part of the [University
of the Highlands and Islands][UHI]. I teach mostly programming and
software-related courses, at all levels from Further Education (Level 6 in the
Scottish system) to honours (Level 10). I am the Programme Leader for
the [UHI BSc (Hons) Computing degree][degree]. I am involved in research in
computing education.
