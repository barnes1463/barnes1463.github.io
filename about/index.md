title: About
---

My name is Ian Barnes.


Why?
----

Because "better out than in". Or to express that idea a little more fully: in
life there's a natural flow in and out of every organism. We take in, and we
give out. For most of my life I've taken in a lot in the way of ideas. I'm a
constant reader, watcher, viewer, listener. But I haven't tended to produce
much. The outward flow has been blocked. This blog is an attempt to rectify
that.

Bio
---

I was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia. My parents are/were both
mathematicians and I initially followed in their footsteps, studying pure
mathematics and computer science and later applied mathematics at the Australian
National University in Canberra. I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux and
ANU, then taught mathematics at the University of Sydney and at Macquarie
University Sydney. I changed fields to computing in the late 90's and taught at
the ANU for almost ten years. I am also a qualified psychotherapist and
counsellor.

I am interested in personal growth and healing from trauma, in science fiction,
science, politics, the environment, music and hill walking.



Home
----

I live in the north of Scotland, in a cottage in the country, near the village
of Croy. This is next to the River Nairn, a bit inland, midway between Inverness
and Nairn. A couple of miles south of Inverness Airport. (I'll do a Google Maps
link soon.)

I am married to [Avigail Abarbanel] [Avigail]. Here's a plug for her
psychotherapy practice, [Fully Human Psychotherapy] [FH].

I am a member of the [Mankind Project] [MKP], and attend the Forres I-Group.
